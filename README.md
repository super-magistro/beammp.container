Here‚Äôs a straightforward Docker setup to run the BeamMP server for BeamNG.drive
on **ARM64** platforms like Raspberry Pi or ARM-based servers.

This image automates server download, config generation via environment variables, and mod folder mounting.
It is ideal for self-hosted BeamMP servers with minimal setup.

## Project Contents

* `Dockerfile` ‚Äì Based on Debian 12, installs required dependencies
* `start.sh` ‚Äì Smart launch script that:

  * downloads the latest BeamMP server version;
  * generates the config file from a template and environment variables.
* `docker-compose.yml` ‚Äì For easy container deployment
* `.env` ‚Äì Server environment configuration file
* `config/ServerConfig.toml.template` ‚Äì Configuration template

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

* Docker
* `docker-compose`
* A valid BeamMP Keymaster key: [https://keymaster.beammp.com/](https://keymaster.beammp.com/)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/super-magistro/beammp.container.git
cd beammp.container
```

### 2. Configure the environment

Edit the `.env` file to customize your server, including the port you want to expose:

```dotenv
SERVER_NAME="MyServer"
AUTH_KEY="your-keymaster-key"
MAX_PLAYERS=12
MAP="/levels/east_coast_usa/info.json"
PORT=16383               # External port to expose your server (default is 30814)
```

### 3. Launch the server

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

The server will be available on the port specified by `PORT` (both TCP and UDP).

## üîÅ Container Behavior

On each start:

* The script fetches the latest BeamMP release.
* If an update is available, it downloads and installs it.
* The configuration file is generated from `ServerConfig.toml.template` using environment variables, unless already present.

## üìÅ Volume Mounts

Two volumes are mounted to manage your server and client mods:

| Host Path       | Container Path                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `./mods/Server` | `/beammp/data/Resources/Server` |
| `./mods/Client` | `/beammp/data/Resources/Client` |

Simply drop and manage your mods into these folders.

## üó∫Ô∏è Available Maps

Valid values for the `MAP` variable:

```
/levels/west_coast_usa/info.json
/levels/italy/info.json
/levels/east_coast_usa/info.json
/levels/gridmap_v2/info.json
/levels/cliff/info.json
... (see .env for the full list)
```

## üîå Port Mapping and Router Forwarding

The BeamMP server listens internally on port `30814`. You can expose it on any external port by setting the `PORT` environment variable in `.env`.

For example, if you set:

```dotenv
PORT=16383
```

Then in `docker-compose.yml`, the port mapping should use this variable, like so:

```yaml
services:
  beammp:
    ports:
      - "${PORT:-30814}:${30814}/tcp"
      - "${PORT:-30814}:${30814}/udp"
```

Make sure to forward the **same external port** (`16383` in this example) on your router to your host machine, so clients can reach your server.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Auto Restart

This container is configured to restart automatically (`restart: unless-stopped`) in case of crash or system reboot.
